# Disaster_Tweet

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing and classifying tweets into two categories:

**Disaster-related tweets**: Tweets indicating a natural disaster or emergency situation.
**Non-disaster-related tweets**: Tweets unrelated to disasters.

** Load Dataset and Import Necessary Libraries **

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Checked the structure, shape, missing values, and duplicate records in the datasets (train_df and test_df).
Visualized the distribution of disaster and non-disaster tweets using a pie chart.

**Word Cloud Generation:**

Concatenated all the tweets for disaster and non-disaster categories separately.
Used the WordCloud library to visualize the most frequent words in disaster and non-disaster tweets.
Created side-by-side visualizations for easy comparison.
